# Agent usage

An agent can use the same CLI as a person. Default output remains text; select `--output json` explicitly for structured results. No agent detection, separate runtime, or agent-specific plugin is required. These examples apply to callers such as Claude Code and Codex; actual organization and cloud pilots are separate from this CLI contract.

```sh
terragraph validate --output json
terragraph graph --output json
terragraph status --output json
terragraph plan --output json
```

Use the existing blueprint runtime configuration or `--tofu` for OpenTofu. Terraform state and S3 backend behavior are unchanged. Execution-record storage is configured separately from state storage; see [execution records](executions.md).

## Results and errors

Read stdout as one JSON value and inspect the exit status. Stderr carries human diagnostics and runtime progress; it is not a machine-readable API. Errors normally exit 1. Native `run` retains its native exit-code behavior and does not support this JSON contract.

| Command | Result shape and identity |
| --- | --- |
| `validate` | `schema_version`, `valid`, `problems`; no execution ID |
| `graph` | `schema_version`, `levels`, `diagnostics`; no execution ID |
| `status`, `output` | Existing `schema_version`, `nodes`, `diagnostics`; no execution ID |
| Ordinary `plan`, `apply`, `destroy` | `schema_version`, `nodes`, `diagnostics`, optional `execution_id` |
| `apply --plan <id>` | Same run shape; `execution_id` is the selected execution |
| `plan --save`, `plan list`, `plan show`, `plan cancel` | Existing `schema_version`, `executions`, `diagnostics`; IDs are `executions[].id` |
| `plan recover` | Existing flat record `id`, with `schema_version` and `diagnostics`; a known partial record survives failure |
| `plan prune` | `schema_version`, `removed`, `diagnostics`; no new execution |
| `vendor` | Array with per-node diagnostics; global failures use the exception below |

Explicit scope selection using repeated `--node` flags and optional `--downstream` retains the existing `selection` object alongside execution IDs and diagnostics. A resolved selection survives preparation failure even when no execution ID has been acquired. Saved executions keep their recorded scope and reject selection overrides.

Object schemas remain version 1. Ignore unknown additive fields. Nodes retain existing order, status strings, and optional human `error` fields. Node-specific diagnostics belong beside the node; independent global failures, including final journal writes, appear in top-level diagnostics. Inspect both. A warning alone does not turn success into failure.

When no command result is available, an identifiable `--output json` request returns an error-only object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "diagnostics": [{
    "code": "invalid_arguments",
    "category": "arguments",
    "severity": "error",
    "phase": "arguments",
    "subject": "command",
    "message": "an argument is invalid"
  }]
}
```

Do not infer `valid: false` when blueprint loading failed: validation did not run. Plan, observation, and history retain their existing empty-result envelopes for failures inside their command handlers. Failures before dispatch use the error-only shape. The CLI emits at most one result, including when a JSON write fails; consumers must still handle missing or truncated output after process termination or an unwritable pipe.

Both `--output json` and `--output=json` are recognized using flag metadata, including when an earlier flag fails to parse. Values belonging to other flags and arguments after `--` are not output selection. Invalid or ambiguous output selection, help, version, and completion keep their existing behavior. `--raw` and `--backup` cannot be combined with JSON: conflicts fail before output values or native state are disclosed. `run`, `lsp`, and `force-unlock` do not gain JSON support.

Vendor keeps its array for success and node failures. A global failure with no results uses the error-only object; a global failure with partial results uses `{ "schema_version": 1, "results": [...], "diagnostics": [...] }`. This is a deliberate change to the nonzero-exit shape previously used for global vendor failures.

## Branch on diagnostics

Diagnostics have `code`, `category`, `severity`, `phase`, `subject`, and `message`. `remedy`, `related_execution_id`, and source location (`source.file`, `source.line`, `source.column`) are optional. Branch on code/category rather than parsing messages, remedies, or Terraform stderr. Existing codes, including plan inspection and observation codes, remain meaningful.

| Category | Caller action |
| --- | --- |
| `arguments`, `configuration`, `validation` | Correct the indicated input or declaration before retrying |
| `lock` | Resolve or wait for the active executor; do not automatically force-unlock |
| `policy` | Review changes and declared policy; the JSON flag does not grant approval |
| `recovery` | Inspect the referenced execution and actual state before continuing |
| `artifact` | Inspect saved-plan compatibility or expiry; create a fresh plan when instructed |
| `record` | Inspect the execution store; a failed write does not prove infrastructure was unchanged |
| `runtime`, `cancelled`, `unknown` | Inspect the execution and node outcomes before deciding whether retry is appropriate |

Common codes include `invalid_arguments`, `policy_blocked`, `recovery_required`, `execution_record_write_failed`, `execution_record_conflict`, `saved_plan_expired`, `saved_plan_incompatible`, `runtime_failed`, `dependency_not_reached` (a dependent that never started because a prerequisite failed), and `cancelled`. Graph problems expose codes such as `missing_input`, `missing_output`, `input_conflict`, `dependency_cycle`, and the existing contract identifiers `C001`–`C009`. Unknown codes must remain visible to the caller; they are not permission to retry automatically.

Saved-execution store-open failures, missing records, and unreadable records use `execution_read_failed` with category `record`. They do not establish a plan incompatibility or justify creating a new plan. `saved_plan_incompatible` is reserved for actual artifact, binding, or resume incompatibilities.

An `execution_id` comes from the existing acquired execution session. It is retained after later failures. `related_execution_id` can point to an earlier execution blocking progress or an allocated ID whose initial persistence failed; neither means a new executable session exists. Commands such as validate and status do not need IDs to report useful results.

## Review and mutate separately

`plan` returning `policy_decision: "block"` is a successful assessment, not a failed mutation. Ordinary apply replans; an ordinary inspection result is not an executable artifact. For retained plans, use the existing workflow:

```sh
terragraph plan --save --output json
terragraph plan show <execution-id> --output json
```

After the caller has authorized the intended mutation:

```sh
terragraph apply --plan <execution-id> --auto-approve --output json
```

JSON apply and destroy require `--auto-approve` to avoid hidden interactive prompts. Declared policy checks still apply. Never automatically replay an uncertain mutation or treat `cancelled`, a missing record, or a failed journal write as proof that nothing changed. No automatic recovery, retry, approval bypass, or sensitive-value disclosure is added by this contract.
